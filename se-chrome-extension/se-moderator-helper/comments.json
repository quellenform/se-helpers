Risking stating the obvious, only you have access to your scene, so unless you describe it thoroughly you alone know your exact setup, settings and what steps you took to arrive where your are now. Describe the issue in detail, add [images](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/75491) of relevant settings and user interface, with the [edit] button above. Don't post comments or ask a new question, editing will automatically queue it for reopening review."

It should be descriptive but succinct, unique and identifying, summarizing the issue in such way that anyone searching for a similar problem may easily find it. Use the [edit] link above, remove anything superfluous, avoid words like &quot;*this*&quot;,&quot;*issue with*&quot; or &quot;*question about*&quot;. Remember, your title is the first thing potential visitors will see, answers you get depend heavily on how inviting it is.

Have in mind that we are learning resource, and require showing a minimum of effort towards your goal, as it stands answering your post would just boil down to doing your work for you, which is beyond the scope of the site. Use the [edit] button, to include information about what you have tried, why it failed and where exactly you are having difficulties. Once edited the question is automatically queued up for reopening."

      "description": "Hello and welcome. As it stands this question is too broad to be answerable without requiring an extensive tutorial or description. You should show efforts towards reaching your goal, describing what you have tried and why it failed, so we don't risk recommending something you already know. The scope should also focus on a particular step you encountered an issue with. Describing the whole procedure from start to finish would be too lengthy to explain, and is beyond the goal of this site. If you could [edit] your post to focus on where you are stuck we can vote to reopen it."

This question seems to have already been asked in various forms over time and already has a multiple answers, but you never acknowledged any of the existing posts. We are not sure if you aware of them but none of the described techniques fulfil your particular requisites, or you simply didn't do any research at all.

If it requires a full tutorial the question is either [too broad and needs to be narrowed down](https://blender.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/62) to a more specific issue; or it can be solved with a simple web search which you can easily do yourself. Please don't post another question. If you could you rephrase the current one to read more like a direct inquiry about your issue, rather than pointing you to a link, you can [edit] it so it can be reopened."

As it stands it is not a good fit for this site."

For commissioning work, job posts or hiring someone, there is a paid work section at [Blender Artists Forum](https://blenderartists.org). Otherwise rephrase your question so it shows your efforts towards solving the issue, rather than ask for someone to do it for you, so it can be reopened."

This question is considered off topic here and was put on hold for being subjective and attracting opinion based answers, because there are no &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; answers and every suggestion is equally valid. For art critique, tips, artistic input, or other opinion based suggestions it is best to ask over at [Blender Artists Forum](https://blenderartists.org/) or similar forums.

These transitory questions are unlikely to be useful in the future, rendering their long term value low, and making them unappealing for a knowledge database site."
